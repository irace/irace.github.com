    <p>Hello. I studied computer science at Boston College and have been developing software professionally
        since 2008. My experience is primarily in front-end web development and design, native iOS
        applications, and full-stack Java web applications and services.</p>

    <p>I am currently focused on <a href="#programming">learning</a> JavaScript (the language
        itself, the Node.js platform, and frameworks such as Backbone), <a href="#music">creating</a>
        digital music with Ableton Live, and <a href="http://blog.bryanirace.com">writing</a> about software.

                <dd>A simple, unobtrusive tool for pushing webpages from one device to another. The destination
                    computer runs a lightweight HTTP server and source devices (e.g. laptops/phones/tablets) use
                    a bookmarklet to send over the desired page.

                <dt><a href="http://bryanirace.com/balances">Balances</a></dt>
                <dd>A mobile web app for keeping track of money you owe and is owed to you. Built using jQuery
                    Mobile, Node.js, Express/Jade, MongoDB/Mongoose, and the Facebook Open Graph API.
