          Hello üëã! I‚Äôm a polyglot engineering leader who enjoys working across all parts of the technology stack and on all facets of an
          organization. I also <a href="https://irace.me/writing/">write</a> and am somewhat of a lapsed
          <a href="https://irace.me/talking/">public speaker</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="copy">
          I‚Äôve spent the better part of the last decade focusing on native iOS development, while still also building plenty of frontend web
          applications and servers. I solve problems and choose the right technology for each job.
        </p>

        <p class="copy">
          My technical skills are complemented by managerial experience, product sensibilities, and a ‚Äúno job too big or too small‚Äù approach
          to collaboration. I voraciously empower software teams to do their very best work.

            I was hired by <a href="https://twitter.com/scottbelsky">Scott Belsky</a> (Behance, Adobe) to lead engineering as part of
            Prefer‚Äôs founding team (third full-time employee, first in NYC). We tried to build ‚Äúthe platform for the future of work,‚Äù a
            referral network to support meaningful independent careers across numerous professions. We raised our Series A from
            <a href="http://www.benchmark.com">Benchmark</a>, <a href="http://expa.com">Expa</a>,
            <a href="https://www.helloangels.co">#Angels</a>, <a href="https://homebrew.co">Homebrew</a>, and other top-tier investors.
          </p>

          <p class="copy">
            We built four different products over the course of over three years, comprised of three native iOS applications, two
            React/TypeScript codebases, two Ruby on Rails servers (one using REST and one using GraphQL), and
            <a href="https://www.soloistcollective.com/">one offline community</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="copy">
            While the company didn‚Äôt ultimately succeed, it was an incredible experience alongside the best team I could‚Äôve possibly hoped
            for.
