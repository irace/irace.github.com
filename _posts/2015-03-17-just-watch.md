Having a sensor-packed computer on your wrist for [identity/payments/etc](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/disney-magicband/). is going to be awesome in like, three or four years, when sensor technology is better, battery life is improved, the cases are a bit smaller, and crucially, there are way more Internet-connected devices to interact with [both in our homes and while out and about](http://exponent.fm/episode-037-apple-watch-take-two/).

In the meantime, hearing people discuss smartwatches’ merits – or lack thereof – will become unbearable. It already is.

[Apple is smart to release it now and to frame the narrative largely around getting people interested in actually being seen wearing it](http://stratechery.com/2015/apple-make-wearable-market/), followed by what I can only assume will be years of both working hard and waiting patiently for the rest of the pieces to fall into place. If anyone can afford a long play like this, it’s the company with $160B in cash. It’s a much longer play than the iPhone or iPad were. [Not to mention that it’ll probably generate a shit-ton of revenue in the interim](http://www.imore.com/over-60-million-americans-interested-buying-apple-watch).

[It’s not the end of a trek](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/474082459860992000) but we’ll be reading articles that treat it as such for quite some time.
