I’m Bryan – a software developer from Brooklyn, NY. You can follow me on Twitter [here](http://twitter.com/irace).

I’m currently trying to figure out what’s next.

Most recently, I was a founding team member and CTO at a company called Prefer (founded by [Scott Belsky](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky) of Adobe/Behance). We worked on Prefer – a platform to power good jobs and the future of independent work – for over three years but eventually shut down in January 2019. I’m very sad that we couldn’t make it work, but am incredibly grateful for the opportunity and experience.

I led development on [Tumblr for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tumblr/id305343404?mt=8) from March 2012 through November 2015. During my last few months there, I also ran the core Android, API, and internal developer tooling teams.

Prior to Tumblr, I worked in [Goldman Sachs](http://gs.com)’ investment research technology division. I ostensibly had the very first Mac on the GS network, while building the iPad app which would become Goldman’s first in the App Store.

Previously, I studied computer science and mathematics at [Boston College](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/cs/).
