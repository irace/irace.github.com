I’m Bryan – a software developer from Brooklyn, NY working on [Prefer](http://prefer.com). You can follow me on Twitter [here](http://twitter.com/irace).

I led development on [Tumblr for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tumblr/id305343404?mt=8) from March 2012 through November 2015. During my last few months there, I also ran the core Android, API, and internal developer tooling teams.

Prior to Tumblr, I worked in [Goldman Sachs](http://gs.com)’ investment research technology division. I ostensibly had the very first Mac on the GS network, while building the iPad app which would become Goldman’s first in the App Store.

Previously, I studied computer science and mathematics at [Boston College](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/cs/).
